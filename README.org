* 🛠 Overview
This is my personal Doom Emacs configuration, customized primarily for:
- 📝 Writing documents efficiently
- 📄 Exporting to PDF via LaTeX
- 🏗 Structured note-taking with Org mode

Doom Emacs provides a minimal yet powerful environment for writing, and I have customized it to enhance productivity in document creation.

* 🚀 Features
My Doom configuration includes:

- **Org mode enhancements**: Better organization, easy exporting, and integrations
- **LaTeX support**: Direct PDF export using `org-latex-export-to-pdf`
- **Markdown & JSON support**: For handling different document formats
- **PDF Tools**: Enhanced PDF reading and annotation inside Emacs
- **Spell & Grammar Checking**: Integrated Flyspell and LanguageTool for better writing
- **Workspaces**: For managing multiple writing projects

* 📦 Installed Doom Modules
I use the following Doom Emacs modules for writing:

**Editor & UI:**
- =evil= +everywhere → Vim keybindings everywhere
- =word-wrap= → Soft wrapping with proper indentation
- =modeline= → Snazzy status bar
- =workspaces= → Persistent workspace support

**Writing & Export:**
- =org +pretty +noter +roam2 +pandoc +dragndrop +journal= → Enhanced Org mode
- =latex= → Writing academic papers with LaTeX
- =markdown= → Support for markdown documents

**Utilities:**
- =pdf= → Better PDF viewing inside Emacs
- =spell +flyspell= → Spell checking for writing
- =grammar= → Grammar checking support

* 📄 LaTeX PDF Export
I have configured Org mode to allow seamless LaTeX exports. To generate a PDF:

1. Write your document in an Org file.
2. Use `C-c C-e l o` to export it to a PDF.
3. Ensure =texlive= and required LaTeX packages are installed.

If the exported PDF appears in **dark mode**, it may be due to `pdf-tools`. You can disable it with:
```elisp
(add-hook 'pdf-view-mode-hook (lambda () (pdf-view-midnight-minor-mode -1)))
